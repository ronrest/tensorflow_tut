# Tensorflow Basics Tutorials

These tutorials are designed to guide you through the basic components of tensorflow. They are designed to work on Tensorflow 0.12 (and possibly later). Where there are incompatability issues with older versions, there will be subsections that discuss how to get things to work on v0.11 (and possibly oder versions).
